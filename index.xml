I spent over 10 years at Percona, first as a MySQL Consultant, then as a manager, then as an IT doer of things, finally as the Director of IT. Earlier this year I made the decision to return to an individual contributor status at a new company, Block, or more specifically, Square.
What I&amp;rsquo;m doing now No doubt some old-timers will remember my blogs at Percona, mostly about PXC and Galera.</description></item></channel></rss>
